Repo contains:

1. game setup
2. game framework
3. a basic heuristic based algorithm to suggest word
4. basic performance measurement

Run each sequentially in order to run game.

Current performance: 3.98 guesses needed on average (down from 5 guesses the previous day). Based on improvement rate, I could get it down to 3.5 with more time.
